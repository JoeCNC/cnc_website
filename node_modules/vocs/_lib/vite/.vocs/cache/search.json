However, there is still a wide range of tools for interpreting these gene expression profiles. \\nThey all have pros, cons, and are still evolving. This, coupled with the fact that these studies rely on the testing of a large number of hypotheses and relatively small sample sizes, lead that whole-genome expression studies in particular, to be often not reproducible. \\nThis is why reproducibility is one of the major challenges facing studies involving whole-genome expression data. [^1], [^2], [^3]\\n\\nFinally, interpreting lists of thousands of differentially expressed genes is a tedious exercise for the biologist. \\n\\nThe GSEA, by dezooming from the scale of the gene to that of the pathway. Improves the reproducibility of studies, \\nwhile facilitating their interpetation.\\n\\n## Principles\\n\\n### What is the question ?\\n\\nLet's says you have ranked a gene list <b><i>L</i></b> according to your favourite metric. The GSEA tries to answer the following question : <br/>\\n<p className=\\\"popacity\\\">\\nGiven a gene set <b><i>S</i></b> : Does the genes belonging to <b><i>S</i></b> tends to occur toward the top (or the bottom) of the list <b><i>L</i></b>, \\nin which case the gene set is correlated with the phenotypic class distinction.\\n</p>\\nOf course we will do as many independant tests as we have genes sets to try.\\nA [multiple testing correction](https://www.firalis.com/products/fimics-cardiac-ruo-kit-panel) should then be considered.\\n\\n### The Method\\n\\n**Step 1 : Compute an enrichment score (ES)**<br/>\\nThis score reflects the degree to which the set S is overrepresented at the extremes top (ES > 0) or bottom (ES < 0) of the ranked list R. It is calculated by walking down the list L, \\nincreasing the running sum when we encounter a gene in S and decreasing it when we encounter genes not in S. Finally the maximum deviation from zero encountered during the random walk is kept as ES. <br/><br/>\\n**Step 2 : Estimation of significance level of ES**<br/>\\nThe nominal P-Value is estimates the statistical significance of the ES by using an empirical phenotype-based permutation test that\\n preserves the correlation structure of the gene expression data. Phenotype labels are permuted and the ES recomputed to generate a null distribution for the ES. The empirical nominal P Value of the observed ES is then calculated relative to\\n  this null distribution. Permutation of class labels preserves gene-gene correlations and thus, provide a more biologically reasonable assessment of significance than would be obtained by permuting genes.<br/><br/>\\n**Step 3 : Adjustment of Multiple Hypothesis Testing.**<br/>\\n The enrichment scores for each set are normalized and a false discovery rate is calculated\\n\\n<p className=\\\"popacitydanger\\\" >\\n  <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>\\n    <strong>It is usefull to keep in mind that</strong>\\n  </div><br />\\n- That the GSEA official software will not complain if you provide them with raw gene expression data. However your results will get totally incorrect results.\\n- You can perform a pre ranked GSEA, which can be very helpful for performing gene set enrichment analysis on data that do not conform to the typical GSEA scenario. For example, it can be used when the ranking metric choices provided by GSEA are not appropriate for the data, or when a ranked list of genomic features deviates from traditional gene expression data (e.g., GWAS results, ChIP seq, etc.). Also if you lack computing power and have access to pre-ranked list, this solution can be your best option.\\n- Clearly define the question your are trying to address and choose the appropriate ranking metrics.\\n- Genes sets curation could be useful as a pre-processing step. Indeed you do not need to perform test on genes set you are not interested in. It will increase your need for computing resources and create supplementary noise for the Adjustment of Multiple Hypothesis Testing procedure.\\n</p>\\n\\n### To go further with theory\\n\\nThere exists a variant of GSEA called FGSEA for <u>F</u>ast <u>G</u>ene <u>S</u>et <u>E</u>nrichment <u>A</u>nalysis.<br/>\\n\\nAnother common approach to perform pathways analysis is the [Gene Ontology Enrichment analysis](https://geneontology.org/docs/go-enrichment-analysis/).\\n\\n## Available programs for practice\\n- [Official Broad institute tools](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/downloads.jsp)\\n- **WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit** \\n[GUI](https://www.webgestalt.org/)\\n[R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WebGestaltR/index.html)\\n- [Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/fgsea.html) (Pre-ranked only)\\n\\n\\n[^1]:  Timothy E.

There are many reasons for this:\\n\\n- Lack of resources and investment capacity to anticipate rapid technological change.\\n- The data professions, which are still in their infancy, have not yet fully penetrated these structures. \\n- Cumbersome legal and administrative constraints on the accreditation of IT solutions for clinical use. \\n\\nTurning to an external service provider is therefore a short-term solution. In the long term, however, outsourcing poses two major problems:\\n\\n- The cost of the outsourced service is ultimately much higher than in-house.\\n- Users (clinical biologists) work free of charge to sort the databases built by these external service providers from the raw data sent to them by the hospitals to which these clinicians belong. \\nThe hospital will therefore once again pay for access to the Ias that have been trained thanks to its work.\\n\\nWith this in mind, I turned my attention to the question of re-internalising this activity at CHUGA. \\nThe analytical part will be the subject of another article, but briefly, \\nthe [nf-core community](https://nf-co.re/) is, in my opinion, the best candidate on which to base this objective. \\n\\nHowever, there is another blocking point.

In order for the gRNA to successfully direct Cas9 cleavage, \\nthe corresponding target DNA sequence in the genome must be found next to a PAM site, \\nalso known as a Protospacer Adjacent Motif. The canonical PAM is associated with the spCas9 nuclease is **5'-NGG-3'**.\\nWe are therefore going to try to draw up an exhaustive list of all the genomic regions that could be used for this \\ngene therapy.\\n1) We start by selecting all the SNPs that are frequent in the population (> 5%), for which we can \\nuse the gnomAD database [^4].  We want the list created to be usable to treat as many \\npatients as possible, so we avoid SNPs that are too rare. \\n2) Only SNPs that induce the disappearance or appearance of the **5‘-NGG-3’**\\n motif will allow us to target only the mutated allele while preserving the WT. To do this, we wrote an in-house script in Python.\\n3) We used the [jvarkit tools suite](https://github.com/lindenb/jvarkit) to reconstitute the genomic context of these SNPs, i.e. \\nto add the flanking sequences to the left and right of our SNPs of interest, according to the human reference genome.\\n4) Finally, we used the [FlashFry](https://github.com/mckennalab/FlashFry) tool to calculate and predict efficiency and specificity \\nscores for each of the positions we selected. We wanted to cut the diseased gene efficiently, \\nwithout altering other regions of the genome.\\n\\nUsing this method, we were able to draw up a list of genomic positions of interest in the treatment of Ryanodine receptor \\ntype 1-related myopathies (RYR1-RM) of the ‘Autosomal-Dominant-Disorder’ type.

However, there is still a wide range of tools for interpreting these gene expression profiles. \\nThey all have pros, cons, and are still evolving. This, coupled with the fact that these studies rely on the testing of a large number of hypotheses and relatively small sample sizes, lead that whole-genome expression studies in particular, to be often not reproducible. \\nThis is why reproducibility is one of the major challenges facing studies involving whole-genome expression data. [^1], [^2], [^3]\\n\\nFinally, interpreting lists of thousands of differentially expressed genes is a tedious exercise for the biologist. \\n\\nThe GSEA, by dezooming from the scale of the gene to that of the pathway. Improves the reproducibility of studies, \\nwhile facilitating their interpetation.\\n\\n## Principles\\n\\n### What is the question ?\\n\\nLet's says you have ranked a gene list <b><i>L</i></b> according to your favourite metric. The GSEA tries to answer the following question : <br/>\\n<p className=\\\"popacity\\\">\\nGiven a gene set <b><i>S</i></b> : Does the genes belonging to <b><i>S</i></b> tends to occur toward the top (or the bottom) of the list <b><i>L</i></b>, \\nin which case the gene set is correlated with the phenotypic class distinction.\\n</p>\\nOf course we will do as many independant tests as we have genes sets to try.\\nA [multiple testing correction](https://www.firalis.com/products/fimics-cardiac-ruo-kit-panel) should then be considered.\\n\\n### The Method\\n\\n**Step 1 : Compute an enrichment score (ES)**<br/>\\nThis score reflects the degree to which the set S is overrepresented at the extremes top (ES > 0) or bottom (ES < 0) of the ranked list R. It is calculated by walking down the list L, \\nincreasing the running sum when we encounter a gene in S and decreasing it when we encounter genes not in S. Finally the maximum deviation from zero encountered during the random walk is kept as ES. <br/><br/>\\n**Step 2 : Estimation of significance level of ES**<br/>\\nThe nominal P-Value is estimates the statistical significance of the ES by using an empirical phenotype-based permutation test that\\n preserves the correlation structure of the gene expression data. Phenotype labels are permuted and the ES recomputed to generate a null distribution for the ES. The empirical nominal P Value of the observed ES is then calculated relative to\\n  this null distribution. Permutation of class labels preserves gene-gene correlations and thus, provide a more biologically reasonable assessment of significance than would be obtained by permuting genes.<br/><br/>\\n**Step 3 : Adjustment of Multiple Hypothesis Testing.**<br/>\\n The enrichment scores for each set are normalized and a false discovery rate is calculated\\n\\n<p className=\\\"popacitydanger\\\" >\\n  <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>\\n    <strong>It is usefull to keep in mind that</strong>\\n  </div><br />\\n- That the GSEA official software will not complain if you provide them with raw gene expression data. However your results will get totally incorrect results.\\n- You can perform a pre ranked GSEA, which can be very helpful for performing gene set enrichment analysis on data that do not conform to the typical GSEA scenario. For example, it can be used when the ranking metric choices provided by GSEA are not appropriate for the data, or when a ranked list of genomic features deviates from traditional gene expression data (e.g., GWAS results, ChIP seq, etc.).
